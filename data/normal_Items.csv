It appears in geode clusters of translucent, sharp-edged crystals which reflect octarine light. The eldritch stones softly hum in dissonant tones, and glow brightly at night or when exposed to magic. Deposits are found throughout Drakkenheim, often fused into stone streets and buildings like crystalline moss.A typical delerium fragment is about the size of a finger. Crystals may be fist-sized or slightly larger, and geodes may be as big as a pumpkin. Massive clusters might grow taller than a human.Delerium CrystalsCrystal SizeMarket ValueWeightACHPExtraction TimeChip10 gold1/4 lbs1551 actionFragment100 gold1/2 lbs17101 minuteShard500 gold1 lbs19155 minutesCrystal1,000 gold2 lbs212030 minutesGeode5,000 gold20 lbs +23251 hourMassive ClusterPriceless8,000 lbs +25507 days Delerium Properties[–] All delerium samples have the following traits regardless of size:Immune to Necrotic, Poison, and Psychic damage; as well as Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage from non-magical weapons.Resistant to Acid, Cold, Fire, and Lightning damage; as well as Slashing and Piercing damage from magical weapons.Vulnerable to Bludgeoning damage from magical weapons.Unless contained within an Antimagic Field, delerium shatters and crumbles into worthless ash when reduced to 0 Hit Points. However, delerium geodes release a random Arcane Anomalies when destroyed. Delerium Hazards[–] When a humanoid creature touches delerium without protective gear for the first time on their turn, or ends their turn in bodily contact with delerium, they must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 Necrotic damage and gain one level of Contamination. Delerium Harvesting[–] Delerium found in Drakkenheim is usually fused into the ground or stone buildings. It is carefully extracted using handheld mining equipment such as shovels, picks, hammers, and chisels. Consult the table to determine how long it takes characters to extract delerium. Lacking proper equipment, extraction takes ten times as long. Massive clusters are impossible to extract without heavy equipment or powerful magic. Uses for Delerium[–] Delerium has vast arcane potential. Beyond trade, crystals are used for several purposes: Spell Component. Delerium may be used as an Arcane Focus or material component for any spell on the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list. When casting a spell which requires a costly material component, a spellcaster may instead use delerium of equivalent or greater value to the required cost. Magic Items. Delerium is an exceptional material for creating magical items of all kinds. Any existing magic item described in the Basic Rules could be made with delerium. Fragments, shards, crystals, and geodes may be used to make uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary items respectively. At the GM's discretion, characters who can cast level 5 spells or higher may learn techniques to craft magic items of their own during their downtime. Stable Delerium. The process for crafting magic items with delerium renders the crystals stable. Unless otherwise specified, characters do not take damage nor risk Contamination when they touch or handle stable delerium. Stable delerium is damaged and destroyed in the same manner as a normal magic item of its kind. Delerium Dust. Delerium dust is made by grinding the crystals against one another to create a fine powder. This milling process is extraordinarily hazardous unless performed within an Antimagic Field. Delerium dust can be used in alchemy, as a spell component, a reagent for brewing potions, or mixed into inks used to scribe spell scrolls. Improvised Weapons & Ammunition. Delerium fragments may be used as ammunition for a Sling or fashioned into a makeshift Club. Such weapons and ammunition deal an extra 1d6 Necrotic damage, and humanoid creatures struck must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of Contamination. Delerium used as ammunition in this way is destroyed."

"Copper (cp)","PHB'14","143","none","Treasure (Coinage)","","","","","0.32 oz.","1 CP","Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound."

It appears in geode clusters of translucent, sharp-edged crystals which reflect octarine light. The eldritch stones softly hum in dissonant tones, and glow brightly at night or when exposed to magic. Deposits are found throughout Drakkenheim, often fused into stone streets and buildings like crystalline moss.A typical delerium fragment is about the size of a finger. Crystals may be fist-sized or slightly larger, and geodes may be as big as a pumpkin. Massive clusters might grow taller than a human.Delerium CrystalsCrystal SizeMarket ValueWeightACHPExtraction TimeChip10 gold1/4 lbs1551 actionFragment100 gold1/2 lbs17101 minuteShard500 gold1 lbs19155 minutesCrystal1,000 gold2 lbs212030 minutesGeode5,000 gold20 lbs +23251 hourMassive ClusterPriceless8,000 lbs +25507 days Delerium Properties[–] All delerium samples have the following traits regardless of size:Immune to Necrotic, Poison, and Psychic damage; as well as Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage from non-magical weapons.Resistant to Acid, Cold, Fire, and Lightning damage; as well as Slashing and Piercing damage from magical weapons.Vulnerable to Bludgeoning damage from magical weapons.Unless contained within an Antimagic Field, delerium shatters and crumbles into worthless ash when reduced to 0 Hit Points. However, delerium geodes release a random Arcane Anomalies when destroyed. Delerium Hazards[–] When a humanoid creature touches delerium without protective gear for the first time on their turn, or ends their turn in bodily contact with delerium, they must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 Necrotic damage and gain one level of Contamination. Delerium Harvesting[–] Delerium found in Drakkenheim is usually fused into the ground or stone buildings. It is carefully extracted using handheld mining equipment such as shovels, picks, hammers, and chisels. Consult the table to determine how long it takes characters to extract delerium. Lacking proper equipment, extraction takes ten times as long. Massive clusters are impossible to extract without heavy equipment or powerful magic. Uses for Delerium[–] Delerium has vast arcane potential. Beyond trade, crystals are used for several purposes: Spell Component. Delerium may be used as an Arcane Focus or material component for any spell on the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list. When casting a spell which requires a costly material component, a spellcaster may instead use delerium of equivalent or greater value to the required cost. Magic Items. Delerium is an exceptional material for creating magical items of all kinds. Any existing magic item described in the Basic Rules could be made with delerium. Fragments, shards, crystals, and geodes may be used to make uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary items respectively. At the GM's discretion, characters who can cast level 5 spells or higher may learn techniques to craft magic items of their own during their downtime. Stable Delerium. The process for crafting magic items with delerium renders the crystals stable. Unless otherwise specified, characters do not take damage nor risk Contamination when they touch or handle stable delerium. Stable delerium is damaged and destroyed in the same manner as a normal magic item of its kind. Delerium Dust. Delerium dust is made by grinding the crystals against one another to create a fine powder. This milling process is extraordinarily hazardous unless performed within an Antimagic Field. Delerium dust can be used in alchemy, as a spell component, a reagent for brewing potions, or mixed into inks used to scribe spell scrolls. Improvised Weapons & Ammunition. Delerium fragments may be used as ammunition for a Sling or fashioned into a makeshift Club. Such weapons and ammunition deal an extra 1d6 Necrotic damage, and humanoid creatures struck must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of Contamination. Delerium used as ammunition in this way is destroyed."

The drug's effects are potentially dangerous and always unpredictable. This isn't something a player character should want to use; adventurers are more likely to interfere with Daask smugglers or deal with an addict who accidentally casts a fireball in a crowded street.

First imported to help manage pain during the Last War, it's now the most commonly abused substance in Sharn. Though dreamlily isn't illegal if used for medicinal purposes, it's heavily taxed, and thus most dreamlily is smuggled in and sold on the black market. Dreamlily dens can be found across the lower wards. Consuming dreamlily causes disorienting euphoria and brings about remarkable resistance to pain. A creature under the effects of dreamlily is poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned in this way, the creature is immune to fear, and the first time it drops to 0 hit points without being killed outright, it drops to 1 hit point instead. A dose of dreamlily costs around 1 gp, or up to ten times that if purchased through legal channels.

A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound."

A ship sailing against a strong wind moves at half speed. In a dead calm (no wind), waterborne ships can't move under sail and must be rowed. Keelboats and Rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can't be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A Rowboat can be carried and weighs 100 pounds. Crew. A ship larger than a Keelboat or Rowboat needs a crew of skilled hirelings (see ""Services"") to function. The minimum number of skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on the type of ship. Passengers. The number of Small and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate using hammocks. A ship outfitted with private accommodations can carry one-fifth as many passengers. A passenger usually pays 5 SP per day for a hammock, but prices can vary from ship to ship. A small private cabin usually costs 2 GP per day. Damage Threshold. See the rules glossary. Ship Repair. Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 Hit Point of damage requires 1 day and costs 20 GP for materials and labor. If the repairs are made in a location where supplies and skilled labor are abundant, such as a city shipyard, the repair time and cost are halved."

However, delerium geodes release a random Arcane Anomalies when destroyed. Delerium Hazards[–] When a humanoid creature touches delerium without protective gear for the first time on their turn, or ends their turn in bodily contact with delerium, they must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 Necrotic damage and gain one level of Contamination. Delerium Harvesting[–] Delerium found in Drakkenheim is usually fused into the ground or stone buildings. It is carefully extracted using handheld mining equipment such as shovels, picks, hammers, and chisels. Consult the table to determine how long it takes characters to extract delerium. Lacking proper equipment, extraction takes ten times as long. Massive clusters are impossible to extract without heavy equipment or powerful magic. Uses for Delerium[–] Delerium has vast arcane potential. Beyond trade, crystals are used for several purposes: Spell Component. Delerium may be used as an Arcane Focus or material component for any spell on the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list. When casting a spell which requires a costly material component, a spellcaster may instead use delerium of equivalent or greater value to the required cost. Magic Items. Delerium is an exceptional material for creating magical items of all kinds. Any existing magic item described in the Basic Rules could be made with delerium. Fragments, shards, crystals, and geodes may be used to make uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary items respectively. At the GM's discretion, characters who can cast level 5 spells or higher may learn techniques to craft magic items of their own during their downtime. Stable Delerium. The process for crafting magic items with delerium renders the crystals stable. Unless otherwise specified, characters do not take damage nor risk Contamination when they touch or handle stable delerium. Stable delerium is damaged and destroyed in the same manner as a normal magic item of its kind. Delerium Dust. Delerium dust is made by grinding the crystals against one another to create a fine powder. This milling process is extraordinarily hazardous unless performed within an Antimagic Field. Delerium dust can be used in alchemy, as a spell component, a reagent for brewing potions, or mixed into inks used to scribe spell scrolls. Improvised Weapons & Ammunition. Delerium fragments may be used as ammunition for a Sling or fashioned into a makeshift Club. Such weapons and ammunition deal an extra 1d6 Necrotic damage, and humanoid creatures struck must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of Contamination. Delerium used as ammunition in this way is destroyed."

A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions.

Advanced Equipment[–] The brilliant engineers and crafters who designed and built Etharis's highly advanced weapons and ammunition did not stop there. Other inventions of war—and of peace—became invaluable to the soldiers, guards, and adventurers of Etharis.Some pieces of Advanced equipment, such as the corrupting Shadowsteel Focus, need special training to fully employ. Other items, like the Retractable Shield, are usable by anyone proficient with shields. And many other pieces of equipment are usable by anyone—though few would be able to afford and maintain these mechanical, alchemical, or even magical marvels.As they are expensive and difficult to make, access to Advanced equipment is limited—maybe even as limited as some magic items. The largest cities, or locations housing master crafters, may only have a few items of Advanced equipment."

It appears in geode clusters of translucent, sharp-edged crystals which reflect octarine light. The eldritch stones softly hum in dissonant tones, and glow brightly at night or when exposed to magic. Deposits are found throughout Drakkenheim, often fused into stone streets and buildings like crystalline moss.A typical delerium fragment is about the size of a finger. Crystals may be fist-sized or slightly larger, and geodes may be as big as a pumpkin. Massive clusters might grow taller than a human.Delerium CrystalsCrystal SizeMarket ValueWeightACHPExtraction TimeChip10 gold1/4 lbs1551 actionFragment100 gold1/2 lbs17101 minuteShard500 gold1 lbs19155 minutesCrystal1,000 gold2 lbs212030 minutesGeode5,000 gold20 lbs +23251 hourMassive ClusterPriceless8,000 lbs +25507 days Delerium Properties[–] All delerium samples have the following traits regardless of size:Immune to Necrotic, Poison, and Psychic damage; as well as Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage from non-magical weapons.Resistant to Acid, Cold, Fire, and Lightning damage; as well as Slashing and Piercing damage from magical weapons.Vulnerable to Bludgeoning damage from magical weapons.Unless contained within an Antimagic Field, delerium shatters and crumbles into worthless ash when reduced to 0 Hit Points. However, delerium geodes release a random Arcane Anomalies when destroyed. Delerium Hazards[–] When a humanoid creature touches delerium without protective gear for the first time on their turn, or ends their turn in bodily contact with delerium, they must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 Necrotic damage and gain one level of Contamination. Delerium Harvesting[–] Delerium found in Drakkenheim is usually fused into the ground or stone buildings. It is carefully extracted using handheld mining equipment such as shovels, picks, hammers, and chisels. Consult the table to determine how long it takes characters to extract delerium. Lacking proper equipment, extraction takes ten times as long. Massive clusters are impossible to extract without heavy equipment or powerful magic. Uses for Delerium[–] Delerium has vast arcane potential. Beyond trade, crystals are used for several purposes: Spell Component. Delerium may be used as an Arcane Focus or material component for any spell on the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list. When casting a spell which requires a costly material component, a spellcaster may instead use delerium of equivalent or greater value to the required cost. Magic Items. Delerium is an exceptional material for creating magical items of all kinds. Any existing magic item described in the Basic Rules could be made with delerium. Fragments, shards, crystals, and geodes may be used to make uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary items respectively. At the GM's discretion, characters who can cast level 5 spells or higher may learn techniques to craft magic items of their own during their downtime. Stable Delerium. The process for crafting magic items with delerium renders the crystals stable. Unless otherwise specified, characters do not take damage nor risk Contamination when they touch or handle stable delerium. Stable delerium is damaged and destroyed in the same manner as a normal magic item of its kind. Delerium Dust. Delerium dust is made by grinding the crystals against one another to create a fine powder. This milling process is extraordinarily hazardous unless performed within an Antimagic Field. Delerium dust can be used in alchemy, as a spell component, a reagent for brewing potions, or mixed into inks used to scribe spell scrolls. Improvised Weapons & Ammunition. Delerium fragments may be used as ammunition for a Sling or fashioned into a makeshift Club. Such weapons and ammunition deal an extra 1d6 Necrotic damage, and humanoid creatures struck must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of Contamination. Delerium used as ammunition in this way is destroyed."

Other inventions of war—and of peace—became invaluable to the soldiers, guards, and adventurers of Etharis.Some pieces of Advanced equipment, such as the corrupting Shadowsteel Focus, need special training to fully employ. Other items, like the Retractable Shield, are usable by anyone proficient with shields. And many other pieces of equipment are usable by anyone—though few would be able to afford and maintain these mechanical, alchemical, or even magical marvels.As they are expensive and difficult to make, access to Advanced equipment is limited—maybe even as limited as some magic items. The largest cities, or locations housing master crafters, may only have a few items of Advanced equipment."

Advanced Equipment[–] The brilliant engineers and crafters who designed and built Etharis's highly advanced weapons and ammunition did not stop there. Other inventions of war—and of peace—became invaluable to the soldiers, guards, and adventurers of Etharis.Some pieces of Advanced equipment, such as the corrupting Shadowsteel Focus, need special training to fully employ. Other items, like the Retractable Shield, are usable by anyone proficient with shields. And many other pieces of equipment are usable by anyone—though few would be able to afford and maintain these mechanical, alchemical, or even magical marvels.As they are expensive and difficult to make, access to Advanced equipment is limited—maybe even as limited as some magic items. The largest cities, or locations housing master crafters, may only have a few items of Advanced equipment."

A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound."

Alternatively, engrossing a target in a game by manipulating the components with dexterous movements is a great distraction for a pickpocketing attempt.Gaming SetActivityDCCatch a player cheating15Gain insight into an opponent's personality15"

"Shard","MoDk","370","none","Delerium","","","","","1 lb.","500 GP","Delerium is a magical mineral left behind by the meteor that landed in Drakkenheim. It appears in geode clusters of translucent, sharp-edged crystals which reflect octarine light. The eldritch stones softly hum in dissonant tones, and glow brightly at night or when exposed to magic. Deposits are found throughout Drakkenheim, often fused into stone streets and buildings like crystalline moss.A typical delerium fragment is about the size of a finger. Crystals may be fist-sized or slightly larger, and geodes may be as big as a pumpkin. Massive clusters might grow taller than a human.Delerium CrystalsCrystal SizeMarket ValueWeightACHPExtraction TimeChip10 gold1/4 lbs1551 actionFragment100 gold1/2 lbs17101 minuteShard500 gold1 lbs19155 minutesCrystal1,000 gold2 lbs212030 minutesGeode5,000 gold20 lbs +23251 hourMassive ClusterPriceless8,000 lbs +25507 days Delerium Properties[–] All delerium samples have the following traits regardless of size:Immune to Necrotic, Poison, and Psychic damage; as well as Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage from non-magical weapons.Resistant to Acid, Cold, Fire, and Lightning damage; as well as Slashing and Piercing damage from magical weapons.Vulnerable to Bludgeoning damage from magical weapons.Unless contained within an Antimagic Field, delerium shatters and crumbles into worthless ash when reduced to 0 Hit Points. However, delerium geodes release a random Arcane Anomalies when destroyed. Delerium Hazards[–] When a humanoid creature touches delerium without protective gear for the first time on their turn, or ends their turn in bodily contact with delerium, they must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 Necrotic damage and gain one level of Contamination. Delerium Harvesting[–] Delerium found in Drakkenheim is usually fused into the ground or stone buildings. It is carefully extracted using handheld mining equipment such as shovels, picks, hammers, and chisels. Consult the table to determine how long it takes characters to extract delerium. Lacking proper equipment, extraction takes ten times as long. Massive clusters are impossible to extract without heavy equipment or powerful magic. Uses for Delerium[–] Delerium has vast arcane potential. Beyond trade, crystals are used for several purposes: Spell Component. Delerium may be used as an Arcane Focus or material component for any spell on the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list. When casting a spell which requires a costly material component, a spellcaster may instead use delerium of equivalent or greater value to the required cost. Magic Items. Delerium is an exceptional material for creating magical items of all kinds. Any existing magic item described in the Basic Rules could be made with delerium. Fragments, shards, crystals, and geodes may be used to make uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary items respectively. At the GM's discretion, characters who can cast level 5 spells or higher may learn techniques to craft magic items of their own during their downtime. Stable Delerium. The process for crafting magic items with delerium renders the crystals stable. Unless otherwise specified, characters do not take damage nor risk Contamination when they touch or handle stable delerium. Stable delerium is damaged and destroyed in the same manner as a normal magic item of its kind. Delerium Dust. Delerium dust is made by grinding the crystals against one another to create a fine powder. This milling process is extraordinarily hazardous unless performed within an Antimagic Field. Delerium dust can be used in alchemy, as a spell component, a reagent for brewing potions, or mixed into inks used to scribe spell scrolls. Improvised Weapons & Ammunition. Delerium fragments may be used as ammunition for a Sling or fashioned into a makeshift Club. Such weapons and ammunition deal an extra 1d6 Necrotic damage, and humanoid creatures struck must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of Contamination. Delerium used as ammunition in this way is destroyed."

A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound."

If the ship takes damage while on or under the water, interior hatches can be sealed to prevent the ship from flooding completely.Standard weaponry on a turtle ship includes three forward-mounted ballistae and a rear-facing mangonel.

This hand crossbow has been modified to support two crossbow mechanisms, each one activated with a separate trigger. Unlike other weapons with loading, it can be fired twice before it needs to be reloaded. If you are proficient with a hand crossbow, you are proficient with a twinshot hand crossbow as well. Range. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range. Ammunition. You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way. Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. Loading. Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make."
